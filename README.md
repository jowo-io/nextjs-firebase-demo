- Figure out why the metadata error wasn't reproducible locally:
  ```
  You are attempting to export "metadata" from a component marked with "use client", which is disallowed. Either remove the export, or the "use client" directive. Read more: https://nextjs.org/docs/getting-started/react-essentials#the-use-client-directive
  ```
- make the boosts live. add where > createdAt query to update when boost is added or removed.
